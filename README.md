# 03-Challenge-PasswordGeneratorProject

On this assigment I'll be using JavaScript to develop a password generator. I'm given a 
starter code where I will base my code on. 

I used my recent knowledge of JavaScript which includes arrays, methods, statements, strings, etc
to succesfully reach the goal of the Challenge.
